1. I used Gemini to remember how to hide and reveal elements using .style.display = 'block' or 'none';
2. I used ChatGPT to get information on why my async function was returning pending promises and how to use them.
    I ended up not returning anything from my async function so I didn't really use this.
3. I asked Gemini about accessability with icons it showed me to set alt text for them just like an img.
4. I used MetaAI to create the weather icon image
